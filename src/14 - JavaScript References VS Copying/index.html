  <title>JS Reference VS Copy</title>

<body>

  <p>This mini project for practicing javascript array and objects copy & reference. take a look at the console</p>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Abdullah';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'mohamed';
    console.log(name, name2);

    console.log('======================================')

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Hossam', 'Samier', 'Ahmed', 'Mazen'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[2] = "Sarah";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    console.log('================================');
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log('print 4 copy of the same array with 4 different method',team, team2, team3, team4); // it will print 4 copy of the same array

    console.log('=====================================');
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Abdullah Muhammed',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@abdo_45",
        facebook: "abdullah.mohammed"
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 1 });
    console.log(captain2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);

    // another method but it is not recommended
    const captain4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log(captain4);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
